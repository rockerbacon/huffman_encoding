All the code presented was implemented for a college work at Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro.
The objective was to implement a program that could compress and decompress files using the huffman encoding.

Program call for compressing:
	rolo_compressor <input file> <output file>
Program call for decompressing:
	rolo_descompressor <input file>
